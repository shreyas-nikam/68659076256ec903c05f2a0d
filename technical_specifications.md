## Technical Specifications for the Credit Default Swap (CDS) Analyzer Streamlit Application

### Overview
This Streamlit application is designed to analyze credit default swaps (CDS) by allowing users to simulate credit events and visualize the resulting payoffs. The application takes key CDS parameters as input, calculates expected payoffs, and presents this information in both tabular and graphical formats. This application supports learning on credit derivatives as a class of derivative contracts between two parties, a credit protection buyer and a credit protection seller, in which the latter provides protection to the former against a specific credit loss.

### Step-by-Step Development Process

1.  **Setup:** Create a new Python environment and install the necessary libraries (Streamlit, Pandas, and potentially NumPy).

2.  **Define Core Functions:** Develop Python functions to calculate the expected payoffs for both the CDS buyer and seller, as well as the premium payment.

3.  **User Interface (UI) Design:** Use Streamlit to create input forms for users to enter CDS parameters (Notional Amount, Premium Rate, Recovery Rate, Probability of Default).

4.  **Calculation and Data Processing:** Capture user inputs, validate them, and use the core functions to calculate the expected payoffs and other relevant metrics.

5.  **Output Display (Payoff Table):** Use Streamlit to create a table displaying the calculated payoffs under different scenarios (Default, No Default).

6.  **Risk Analysis Chart:** Generate a chart (e.g., using Streamlit's `st.line_chart` or a library like `plotly`) visualizing the sensitivity of the CDS payoff to changes in Default Probability and Recovery Rate.

7.  **CDS Diagram:** Create a visual representation or use an existing image to illustrate the relationship between the lender, the CDS buyer, and the CDS seller.

8.  **Documentation:** Add inline help text, tooltips, and explanations to guide users through the application.

9.  **Concept Explanation:** Reference the underlying concepts from the learning document and explain how the app helps understand credit risk and derivatives.

### Core Concepts and Mathematical Foundations

#### Credit Default Swap (CDS)

A Credit Default Swap (CDS) is a financial derivative contract that allows an investor to "swap" or offset their credit risk with that of another investor. It essentially acts as insurance for bondholders, where the CDS seller agrees to compensate the buyer if the bond issuer defaults.

#### Key Formulae Used

-   **Expected Payoff for CDS Buyer (Default)**:
    
$$

    Payoff_{Buyer} = NotionalAmount \times (1 - RecoveryRate) - PremiumPayment
    
$$

-   **Expected Payoff for CDS Seller (Default)**:
    
$$

    Payoff_{Seller} = -NotionalAmount \times (1 - RecoveryRate) + PremiumPayment
    
$$

-   **Premium Payment**:
    
$$

    PremiumPayment = NotionalAmount \times PremiumRate
    
$$

Where:

-   $NotionalAmount$: The notional amount of the CDS contract.
-   $RecoveryRate$: The expected recovery rate in case of a credit event (expressed as a decimal).
-   $PremiumRate$: The annual premium rate paid by the CDS buyer to the CDS seller (expressed as a decimal).
-   $PremiumPayment$: The periodic payment made by the CDS buyer to the seller.

#### Explanations:
-   **Notional Amount**: This is the principal amount of the underlying debt that the CDS is protecting. It's the base amount used to calculate payoffs and premium payments. *Example:* If a CDS has a $1,000,000 notional amount, this is the reference amount used in calculations.
-   **Recovery Rate**: In the event of a default, the *Recovery Rate* is the percentage of the notional amount that the bondholder expects to recover. This value is typically between 0 and 100 percent. *Example:* If the recovery rate is 40% (or 0.4), it means the bondholder expects to recover 40% of the notional amount if the issuer defaults.
-   **Premium Rate**: The *Premium Rate* (also known as the CDS spread) is the annual payment made by the buyer to the seller, expressed as a percentage of the notional amount. *Example*: A premium rate of 1% on a $1,000,000 notional amount would result in an annual premium payment of $10,000. The Premium payment is often divided into quarterly payments.
-   **Expected Payoff**:  Expected Payoff shows what the parties can expect to receive based on the probability of default.

#### Real-World Applications and Context

CDS are used extensively in credit risk management by banks, hedge funds, and other financial institutions. They can be used to hedge credit risk, speculate on creditworthiness, or create synthetic credit exposures.  Understanding CDS payoffs is crucial for anyone involved in fixed-income investing or credit analysis.

### Required Libraries and Dependencies

-   **Streamlit**: Used for building the user interface and deploying the application.

    ```python
    import streamlit as st
    ```

-   **Pandas**: Used for creating and displaying the payoff table.

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    ```

-   **NumPy** (Optional):  Potentially used for numerical calculations, especially when generating risk analysis charts.

    ```python
    import numpy as np
    ```

    If the risk analysis chart uses a library such as `plotly` this will also be required.
    ```python
    import plotly.express as px
    ```

### Implementation Details

The core of the application will consist of the following Python functions:

1.  **`calculate_premium_payment(notional_amount, premium_rate)`**:
    This function calculates the annual premium payment.

    ```python
    def calculate_premium_payment(notional_amount, premium_rate):
        """Calculates the annual premium payment for the CDS."""
        premium_payment = notional_amount * premium_rate
        return premium_payment
    ```

2.  **`calculate_buyer_payoff(notional_amount, recovery_rate, premium_payment)`**:
    This function calculates the expected payoff for the CDS buyer in the event of a default.

    ```python
    def calculate_buyer_payoff(notional_amount, recovery_rate, premium_payment):
        """Calculates the payoff for the CDS buyer in case of default."""
        payoff = notional_amount * (1 - recovery_rate) - premium_payment
        return payoff
    ```

3.  **`calculate_seller_payoff(notional_amount, recovery_rate, premium_payment)`**:
    This function calculates the expected payoff for the CDS seller in the event of a default.

    ```python
    def calculate_seller_payoff(notional_amount, recovery_rate, premium_payment):
        """Calculates the payoff for the CDS seller in case of default."""
        payoff = -notional_amount * (1 - recovery_rate) + premium_payment
        return payoff
    ```

The main part of the Streamlit application will:

1.  Capture user inputs using `st.number_input`.
2.  Call the calculation functions.
3.  Display the results using `st.dataframe` for the payoff table and `st.line_chart` (or `plotly`) for the risk analysis chart.

### User Interface Components

1.  **Input Forms**:
    -   Notional Amount: `st.number_input("Notional Amount", value=1000000)`
    -   Premium Rate: `st.number_input("Premium Rate (decimal)", value=0.01)`
    -   Recovery Rate: `st.number_input("Recovery Rate (decimal)", value=0.4)`
    -   Probability of Default: `st.number_input("Probability of Default (decimal)", value=0.05)`

2.  **Payoff Table**:
    A Pandas DataFrame displayed using `st.dataframe` showing the payoffs for the CDS buyer and seller under Default and No Default scenarios.

3.  **Risk Analysis Chart**:
    A line chart (using Streamlit's built in charting, or Plotly) visualizing the CDS payoff sensitivity to changes in `RecoveryRate` and `ProbabilityOfDefault`.  The user might select which variable to vary with a `st.selectbox`.

4.  **CDS Diagram:**
    An image displayed using `st.image` or a graphical representation created using Streamlit components to visually explain the CDS contract structure (Lender, CDS Buyer, CDS Seller).
